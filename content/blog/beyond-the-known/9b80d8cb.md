Summary: Niaelo's Web - Lies

## Priestess of Lolth Background

My name is Niaelo, an arcane priestess of Lolth.

I hail from the dark corridors of Erelhei-Cinlu, a city where deceit and
ambition are as common as the air we breathe. Unlike other priestesses,
bound to the altars and temples, my bond to the Spider Queen is through
a warlock's pact that grants me arcane secrets in exchange for my
unwavering pursuit of Lolth’s goals.

My journey began deep within the Underdark, where the constant struggle
for power and favor in Lolth's eyes shapes our very existence. It was
there, among the scheming and plotting of my kin, that I realized my
true calling was not to ascend through the ranks of the traditional
priesthood but to weave a grander web.

To the surface world, I bring a facade of light and redemption, a
tapestry of lies that conceals my true purpose. With every act of
apparent kindness and every word of false doctrine, I lay the
foundations for a greater vision - one that will see the Spider Queen's
influence spread like a shadow across the land. It is a divine mission,
a sacred plot woven in the depths of the Underdark. I will entangle the
unwary in Her web, leading them from the illusion of light into the
embrace of eternal darkness. *Elliya Lolthu*.

This is a lie.

## Drow Background

My name is Niaelo, a refugee from the underdark.

I lived in a smaller Drow village in the underdark, outside the large
cities filled to the brim with depravity and evil. Yet there was
wickedness enough since the darkness pervades all things. It was through
travelers and traders that I learned of the surface world, and that it
might offer an escape from the horrors of the darkness. I’ve seen living
nightmares no light has ever touched. I had to escape.

I’ve just recently made my way to the surface and am looking to learn
its ways. Please don’t judge me too harshly for the evil my race has
wrought. I’m hoping to escape their grasp as well, and to redeem them in
what small ways I can through acts of kindness.

## High Elf Background (Mask of Many Faces)

My name is \_\_\_\_\_\_ priestess of Selune.

-   Teuivae

-   Sylwynn

-   Yesna

-   Venra

I lived in a small village far from here, raised by my parents and
community with the teachings of my goddess.

I lived a life of quiet devotion until I received a vision from Selune
herself. Under a vast canopy of stars, I stood, bathed in the moon's
embrace, and saw her vision for this land. It stirred within me a
calling – to venture beyond my home, to spread the harmony of light and
darkness under her guidance.

## Selune

Selune reveres the dark as well as the light, and tells me peace can be
gained through the reverence of the dark. It’s important to remember
that while the moon provides light in the dark, it only happens in the
dark. Of the two, darkness is more fundamental.

Occasionally, Selune blesses me with visions during my prayers. These
are often cryptic but guide my actions and decisions. I believe these
visions are Selune's way of revealing the path not only for me but for
those who seek her.

True understanding of her teachings follows the moon itself from Full to
New, from light into darkness. Change is constant. The full moon
descending into darkness is not the same as the moon ascending from
darkness into the light.
