## Abstract

YouTube videos are categorized into a number of
classes such as music, entertainment, sports. This paper
will explore how these categories are related, how strongly they
are related, and the techniques used to gain this information.
Data mining, graph analysis, and visualization techniques will be
leveraged to accomplish this goal.


## Introduction
YouTube is the preeminent public video sharing platform
on the internet today. Itâ€™s vast array of examples of human
behavior can provide insight into how we as a society categorize
activities, and how those categorizations are related to each
other. Each video has a number of attributes we can mine,
including variable number of related videos. We can use the
related video information to construct a social network of videos
that show their relationships.

The related videos are determined by YouTube algorithmi-
cally, not by hand, so this approach is not as organic as human
labeled data. However, the machine labeling allows access to
a much greater data set.

This work seeks to explore the relationships between videos
through first order attributes and infer second order relationships
such as how similar or dissimilar video categories are.
