> Yo, listen up, you pesky seagull on my deck
>
> I'm Admiral Teach, the bard, and I'm here to wreck
>
> My guitar riffs spark like lightning at sea
>
> My mockery's so vicious, it's got a body count, you'll see

<div></div>

> Captain of chaos, master of the seas
>
> My crew of bones dance to my melodies
>
> Self-made captain, the seas bend to my will
>
> My bardic inspiration hones the whole crew's skill

<div></div>

> We rule these waters with iron and song
>
> Teach and his crew, where we sail, we belong
>
> Skeleton sailors, treasure in our hold
>
> My bardic inspiration hones the whole crew's skill

<div></div>

> We rule these waters with iron and song
>
> Teach and his crew, where we sail, we belong
>
> Skeleton sailors, treasure in our hold
>
> Cross us, little bird, and you'll never grow old

<div></div>

> Next up is Cake, our cleric of storms
>
> Sacrificing fools is just one of his norms
>
> Hurricane god demands tribute in blood
>
> Your feathers might do to appease the flood

<div></div>

> Aztec zealot in a pirate's rough trade
>
> Morals as flexible as the deals we've made
>
> He'd sacrifice his own kin for a favorable wind
>
> Your bones for our necromancy, feathered fiend

<div></div>

> We've sunk submarines, slain devils with glee
>
> Megalodon's teeth? Just trophies to me
>
> Pirate Council knows we're not to be crossed
>
> Mess with us and you'll end up lost

<div></div>

> Titus, half-orc, silent as the deep
>
> His scimitars sing foes to eternal sleep
>
> His rage makes the sea itself step back
>
> Against Titus, you're just a flying snack

<div></div>

> He's wrestled krakens and walked away whole
>
> Your bravado against him is a joke, you droll
>
> Goes with the flow till it's time to brawl
>
> Then he'll make giants and birds look small

<div></div>

> We rule these waters with iron and song
>
> Teach and his crew, where we sail, we belong
>
> Skeleton sailors, treasure in our hold
>
> Cross us, little bird, and you'll never grow old

<div></div>

> Chaser's our wildcard, elf of the sea
>
> Sword-singer, wizard, dressed flamboyantly
>
> His clothes are loud, his magic's brighter
>
> Dazzling and deadly, there's no fiercer fighter

<div></div>

> His spells astound, his blade work is sleek
>
> Your dull grey feathers can't compete with his peak
>
> Outrageous stunts are his claim to fame
>
> Next to Chaser, you're just mundane

<div></div>

> So seagull, you've heard the tales of our crew
>
> We're not here for mercy, that much is true
>
> We're not heroes, we're here for the gold
>
> Fly off now, or sleep in Davy Jones' hold!
