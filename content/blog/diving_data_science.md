Summary: Exploring scuba diving picture categorization with Python and matplotlib

# Introduction

I have another website
[diving.anardil.net](https://diving.anardil.net/gallery/index.html)
for the pictures I've taken while scuba diving around the Puget
Sound, Canada, and South America. The site is really made up of 5 sub
websites and hosts over 4,400 pictures!

For our purposes here, the interesting ones are:

* [Gallery](https://diving.anardil.net/gallery/index.html), Common names
* [Taxonomy](https://diving.anardil.net/taxonomy/index.html), Scientific names

Another side project of mine is poking around with
[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). In the project's own words:
> Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and
> interactive visualizations in Python. Matplotlib makes easy things easy and
> hard things possible.

It really is an amazing library; once you have the basic pattern
down, it does make it really easy to iterate visualizing data. It's
what I'm using for [sensors.anardil.net](https://sensors.anardil.net/) which
shows temperature, humidity, and internet latency for my house.

# Goal

Alright! We have a ton of pictures and a visualization library, what are we doing?

Even organized as the website pages are, it can be hard to get a sense of
proportion between pages. There are a lot of
[nudibranchs](https://diving.anardil.net/gallery/nudibranch.html), but are there
more of those than of [crabs](https://diving.anardil.net/gallery/crab.html)?
What about compared to
[anemones](https://diving.anardil.net/gallery/anemone.html)? Within the
nudibranchs, what's most common?

And most importantly, I'd like to answer these questions with easy to understand
visualizations rather than numbers in a spreadsheet or terminal.

# Looking at the data

I'll be working with the pictures directly on my file system rather than
scraping my own website &#128578;, but that would work too.
The [source code](https://public.anardil.net/code/diving/) that generates
`diving.anardil.net` has utilities to parse the folders and images into two main
hierarchies: common names (octopus, fish, etc) and scientific names
(*Octopoda*, *Actinopterygii*, etc). By hierarchy, I mean that the source code
organizes the pictures into a tree by name.

For instance, `2020-05-30 Rockaway Beach/012 - Juvenile Copper Rockfish.jpg`
gets fit into the following tree:

* [Fish](https://diving.anardil.net/gallery/fish.html)
* [Rock Fish](https://diving.anardil.net/gallery/rock-fish.html)
* [Copper Rock Fish](https://diving.anardil.net/gallery/copper-rock-fish.html)
* [Juvenile Copper Rock Fish](https://diving.anardil.net/gallery/juvenile-copper-rock-fish.html)

The website and source code use the same tree representation. Let's start with
the common names since they're a bit easier to eyeball and know what you're
looking at.

```python
>>> import collection
>>> tree = collection.go()
>>>
>>> type(tree)
<class 'dict'>
>>>
>>> tree.keys()
dict_keys(['shrimp', 'unknown', 'worm', 'eel', 'nudibranch', 'crab', 'fish',
'bryozoan', 'anemone', 'urchin', 'sponge', 'shark', 'star', 'egg', 'coral',
'wreck', 'limpet', 'chiton', 'octopus', 'tunicate', 'barnacle', 'hydroid',
'algae', 'lobster', 'diver', 'jelly', 'snail', 'ray', 'clam', 'scallop',
'shell', 'sea cucumber', 'dive site', 'sea turtle', 'bottlenose dolphin',
'marine iguana'])
>>>
>>> tree['crab'].keys()
dict_keys(['hermit', 'rock', 'helmet', 'dungeness', 'moss', 'decorator',
'porcelain', 'kelp', 'umbrella', 'scaled', 'rhinoceros', 'shore', 'clinging',
'heart', 'arrow', 'sharp nosed', 'spiny lithoid', 'reef spider', 'various'
'puget sound king'])
```
Eventually, the tree branches bottom out into a list of actual pictures.
```python
>>> tree['crab']['helmet']['various']['data']
[Helmet Crab, Helmet Crab, Helmet Crab, Helmet Crab, Helmet Crab, ..., Helmet Crab]
```
So we have a tree of lists! We've hardly explored the tree and there's already
a lot of information to consider; we need a way to summarize what we're seeing.
What if we compared the sizes of sub trees?
```python
>>> import utility
>>>
>>> [(k, utility.tree_size(v)) for (k, v) in tree.items()]
[('shrimp', 109), ('unknown', 17), ('worm', 201), ('eel', 104),
('nudibranch', 563), ('crab', 435), ('fish', 685), ('bryozoan', 53),
...]
```
That's looking more reasonable! We know there are more `worm` pictures than
`shrimp` pictures. But how to visualize it?

# Finding a nice representation

We have some 1 dimensional labeled data. 1 dimensional because each element
only has a single value. Names like `shrimp` and `eel` aren't things we can
plot on a coordinate plane, they're labels. Let's peel that list of tuples
apart to make it more clear.
```python
>>> pairs = [(k, utility.tree_size(v)) for (k, v) in tree.items()]
>>> names, counts = zip(*pairs)
>>>
>>> names[:8]
('shrimp', 'unknown', 'worm', 'eel', 'nudibranch', 'crab', 'fish', 'bryozoan')
>>> counts[:8]
(109, 17, 201, 104, 563, 435, 685, 53)
```
How about a bar graph?
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as m

import collection
from utility import tree_size

tree = collection.go()  # common names
sizes = {k: tree_size(v) for k, v in tree.items()}
names, counts = list(zip(*sorted(sizes.items())))
xs = [i for i in range(len(counts))]

m.bar(xs, counts)
m.title('Diving Pictures')
m.ylabel('Pictures')
m.xticks(xs, names, rotation=45, ha='right')
m.show()
```
![common-names-bar-1](/extra/common-names-bar-1.png "Common Names Bar Chart")

Hmm, nice but that's kind of a lot to look at all at once. Let's add some
grouping; we'll combine groups that don't have many pictures into an `other`
group that will represent them all together. We won't know what exactly they
are, but the chart overall will be more readable.
```python
...
sizes = {k: tree_size(v) for k, v in tree.items()}

for k, v in list(sizes.items()):
    if v > 50:
        continue
    sizes.setdefault('other', 0)
    sizes['other'] += v
    del sizes[k]

names, counts = list(zip(*sorted(sizes.items())))
...
```

Grouped")

A couple things are clear already; there are a ton of pictures of crabs, fish,
and nudibranchs!

# Bubbles, packed and otherwise

If I say "there are 201 pictures of worms", what does that mean? Is that a lot?
Are they super rare?
In general, the values in our data are only **valuable** when compared to each
other, because there isn't an absolute scale available. In this case, a bar
chart is giving us a bit more than we need.

What about a bubble chart instead? If we use the value for each label as the
scale for the bubble's radius, we'd have a clear visual comparison between
groups. A bigger bubble means more pictures, easy!

`matplotlib` has utilities to draw circles and bubble charts, but I specifically
want a _packed_ bubble chart. This is where the circles are moved around in the
chart to fit them in as small a space as possible. This only makes sense when
the circles don't have some other spatial data (think of a population bubble
for countries on a map). Luckily, we don't have extra spatial data!

To this end, we'll be [using an advanced example
script](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/misc/packed_bubbles.html) rather
than just a `matplotlib` builtin.

```python
from plot_utility import BubbleChart

def packed_bubble(names, counts, spacing=5):
    ''' packed bubble plot using packed_bubbles.html from matplotlib.org '''
    chart = BubbleChart(area=counts, bubble_spacing=spacing)
    chart.collapse()

    _, ax = m.subplots(subplot_kw=dict(aspect='equal'))
    default_colors = m.rcParams['axes.prop_cycle']
    colors = default_colors.by_key()['color'] * 50

    chart.plot(ax, names, colors)
    ax.axis('off')
    ax.relim()
    ax.autoscale_view()
    m.show()

tree = collection.go()  # common names
sizes = {k: tree_size(v) for k, v in tree.items()}

for k, v in list(sizes.items()):
    ...
    del sizes[k]

sizes = {
    k.title().replace(' ', '\n') + f'\n{v}': 2 * v
    for k, v in sizes.items()
}
names, counts = list(zip(*sizes.items()))

m.rcParams['figure.dpi'] = 175
m.rcParams.update({'font.size': 7})
packed_bubble(names, counts)
```

Names Packed Bubble Chart")

Cool! The work not shown is the tweaking of `bubble_spacing`, bubble
radius (`2 * v`), and font to make the bubbles and labels fit nicely. I gave
[adjustText](https://github.com/Phlya/adjustText) a shot but couldn't get it to
improve the look, though it did work and may work for a different use case.

From here, it's easy! To visualize other parts of the tree, we just need to
give our code a different root to start with (readjust the spacing, radius, etc
as necessary), and voil√†!

# Conclusion

We used `matplotlib` to visualize some categorized diving pictures! The library
let us get started quickly and easily with a bar chart, and enabled much more
complicated packed bubble charts as well (just like the project description
said it could).
