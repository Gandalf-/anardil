Hellin is a loner, finding herself in Ten Towns to escape the hustle and bustle
of the southern regions. Her travels have taken her further and further north
over time and built her experience as a warrior in recent years. She's taken
up mercenary and guard work to pay the bills and doesn't mind the danger or
drudgery, finding combat and suffering through scrapes comes naturally to her.
Lately, she's taken to guarding docks in the lake towns, moving along
before the dock hands and sailors get too familiar. She respects her comrades
but doesn't get too close, knowing that she'll be moving on soon.

Nonetheless, she's earned a reputation for being reliable, as well as willing
to weather the elements, tend to others' wounds, and face down just about
anyone or anything when necessary. She's admittedly not the strongest or the
most clever, but when it comes time to fight, her agility and fortitude see her
through.

The only reminders of her past are an angry doll and book on Northern Myths
that makes vague allusions to danger when night overtakes the day. This seems
to line up with what's been happening lately; the sun hasn't set or risen for
years, and it's made her increasingly uneasy. Curses and magic are for someone
else to figure out, but she's able and willing to play a part to defend the
region if it comes to that. Ten Towns has grown into a home for her, an unusual
sweet spot where she's learned the local customs to blend in and able to move
along to a similar location when she's ready. A place where she can be an outsider
and insider at the same time.
