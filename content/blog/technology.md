Many new technologies, such as search engines, have made an incredible variety of
information available to more people than ever before. This information includes ideas and
data that may have only been available to a select few, and only under particular
circumstances. I believe human thought and creativity requires a stimulus. Even the most
talented artists must have inspiration in order to produce there works. On this line, I
argue that the increased relance on technology our society has experienced has benefited
our ability to think for ourselves.

In the same fashion that the artist requires inpiration for their pieces, everyone
requires a base of knowledge on which to build ideas and form opinions. The availability
of more ideas and opinions faciliates this goal. Those who would never have been able to
physically visit a large library now have access to their contents, and much more. Perhaps
the more priviledged members of society, in terms of economic stability and access to
these resources, have not seen a drastic increase in availability of knowledge, but this
is surely not the case for the disadvantaged. 

Citizens of developing countries now have access to a wealth of knowledge and ideas,
allowing and stimulating personal thought and improvement. For example, a Saharan farmer
with access to the internet may research and utilize decades of research in botany and
farming to improve his or her own crop. Thinkers and philosophers may also explore a vast
array of ideologies and perspectives with ease, leading to beneficial societal movements
and changes.

All of these benefits hinge on an assumption on human nature; one that may not hold true
for all people. I am assuming that humans will strive to self improve and explore, rather
than towards what is familar and stable. Technology allows everyone to share opposing
opinions, but also to reinforce those opinions already held. If we don't push ourselves
to explore other ideas, we may instead seek to reinforce current views. In this case,
technology can deteriorate the ability of humans to think for themselves.

This type of "feed back loop" does not lend itself to the exploration of new ideas and
encouragement of thinking for one's self. In this case, the technology user enters a
monoculture. Even if the user does not hold the majority's views, if they don't seek out
and  expose themselves to other ideas, they may begin to believe that other perspectives
do not exist. In this case, they are likely to join the majority in whatever opinion is
commonly held, regardless of whether the opinion or ideology is destructive or counter
productive to personal or societal improvement. 

Nonetheless, I will label myself an optimist and say that I do not believe the
majority of the population behaves this way. I have had discussions with friends and
family about ideas that we would have never been exposed to without the facilation of
technology. Likewise, I have seen evidence of societal movements both domestic and
abroad that started from ideas acquired through the internet. Though the possibility
of free thought deteroriation is possible, I believe that the the benefits offered by
technology outweight the risk.
