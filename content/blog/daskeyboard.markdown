Summary: Das Keyboard 4C Ultimate Review

I got my new keyboard about three weeks ago now, and absolutely love it. I can't say much
to compare it with other mechanical keyboards since this is my first, but this is by far
the best keyboard I've ever used. 

The keys are blank, which is pretty cool; but also a bit of a pain as I'm sure you could
imagine. I like to think that I know where all the symbols and numbers are, but I still
find myself counting from the left to figure out where keys are for sure when typing in a
password or something like that.

The keyboard itself is awesome quality. The keys and base are all metal, which makes it
fairly heavy but also very sturdy. Apparently the keys are rated for 50 million presses
before you'll start running into problems. Even if that ever happens, the keyboard is
highly customizable, which makes it easy to replace keys and switches. 

I decided to go with brown switches. After reading about other people's preference, and
considering the environment I'll likely be using the keyboard, brown seemed like the way
to go. They're very quiet compared to blue or even red, but still have a nice tactile
click and bouncy-ness. I really enjoy not having to press the keys down all the way to
have the keystroke register. 

It takes a bit to get used to, but once you have it makes typing much more enjoyable. Less
force, in conjunction with the nicely spaced layout makes typing for longer stints
comfortable. It comes with two USB 2.0 ports too, which is great for a USB drive and my
mouse. It's easy to switch the keyboard between computers, and the mouse comes along with
it without any extra work.

The 10 keyless keyboard felt like the better choice. I don't spend a lot of time just
inputing numbers, so the advantage of having the full number pad was small. The smaller
layout makes it easier to pack around too; it would actually fit in my backpack. The
keyboard is fairly tall, as in the keys' height above the desk, so I'd highly recommend
getting a wrist rest. The edges are just bare metal, and not particularly rounded, making
it uncomfortable to type against without a wrist rest.
