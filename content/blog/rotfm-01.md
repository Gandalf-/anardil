> Bryn Shander is our current home in the frozen wastes of Ten Towns. We've been
> hired on as contractors supporting the local militia and have been picking up
> odd jobs around town.

> Sheriff Southwell has been our contact point for work. We hear from a
> messenger there's new job available and head over to the sheriff's office to
> get the details.

</center>

> We're told that a group of dwarves from Kelvin's Cairn are in need of help;
> they've lost a member of their group to a yeti along with a shipment of
> ingots. They offer some gems as payment and we agree to help after some
> antagonizing on our part and pouting on their part.

</center>

> We have an idea of where to start and head out of town. Our intrepid ranger,
> Belasco the Hunter, is able to lead the party through the tundra with ease.
> His expansive knowledge of the terrain makes our progress towards the area
> of the attack faster than expected.

</center>

> Some time into the journey, we spot a frozen waterfall in the distance.
> Deadly icicles loom from overhangs above.

![05](/extra/rime-01-05.webp "Hellin")
</center>

> Our stalwart fighter, Hellin, can't resist the urge to collect an icicle for
> a snack and narrowly avoids being impaled by falling icicles. The loud
> crash of ice and snow draws the attention of someone or something nearby.

</center>

> An ice witch named Vellynne Harpell appears, flying on a magical disk.
> Despite a wide array of reactions from the party, we're able to exchange
> travel information and learn the location of a nearby dwarven body. This
> might be who we're looking for.

![07](/extra/rime-01-07.webp "Oog the Dead Dwarf")
</center>

> We find the body of Oog, the missing dwarf. The yeti is nowhere to be seen,
> but there are snowshoe and sled tracks leading away from the scene.
> Meanwhile, a blizzard begins to roll in and visibility drops. We have only a
> short time to search for the ingots before we'll be forced to turn back.

<center>
![08](/extra/rime-01-08.webp "Gunnar")
</center>

> We continue to trudge through the snow following the tracks. Our battle-hardened war
> mage, Gunnar Bjornson, spots a tell-tale sign of orc activity and hurls
> firebolts at the shadows in the storm. The party is ready for a fight, but it
> never arrives.

<center>
![09](/extra/rime-01-09.webp "Orc Ambush")
</center>

> Some ways further, we find an orc war wagon pulled by polar bears but
> seemingly no orcs. While we deliberate on what to do next, the orcs
> spring their ambush. A ferocious battle ensues. One orc is incinerated by
> Gunnar's cone of fire, another is cut clean in half by Hellin's sword. Gunnar
> takes a vicious blow from an orc's axe but remains standing.

<center>
![10](/extra/rime-01-10.webp "Gog versus Polar Bear")
</center>

> Despite Belasco's attempts, the polar bears enter the fight. Our sagacious monk,
> Gog, pummels one nearly into submission with a flurry of blows. The bear
> retaliates with a mighty bite and swipe of its claws and Gog hits the snow,
> unconscious. The rest of the party is able to scare off the bears and
> stabilize Gog.

> We recover the lost ingots and return to Bryn Shander. The dwarves are grateful,
> the sheriff impressed, and we collect our reward. We hear our next adventure
> lies in the town of Goodmead, where we hear the speaker has been assassinated
> by a mead stealing giant.
