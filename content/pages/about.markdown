Summary: Description of site

Anardil is my personal website. I'm imagining it to be an outlet to share my ideas on
various topics in computing, security, and programming. Hopefully among other things as
well! Eventually, there will be posts from other authors here too, on any variety of
topics.

What does Anardil mean? It's the name of the 6th king of Gondor from The Lord of the
Rings. The king himself isn't known for anything particularly special. But the name means
"friend of the sun" in Quenya. Despite the Tolkien references, I think it' a very
aesthetically pleasing word, and I really like the meaning. 

If you'd like to contact me, I'm reachable by email at `leaf@anardil.net`
