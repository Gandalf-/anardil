Summary: Description of site

Anardil is my personal website. I'm imagining it to be an outlet to share my
ideas on various topics in computing, security, and programming. Hopefully
among other things as well! Eventually, there will be posts from other authors
here too, on any variety of topics.

What does Anardil mean? It's the name of the 6th king of Gondor from The Lord
of the Rings. The king himself isn't known for anything particularly special.
But the name means "friend of the sun" in Quenya. I think its an aesthetically
pleasing word and like the meaning.

This is a small network of websites:
