Summary: Description of site

Anardil is my personal website. I'm imagining it to be an outlet to share my
ideas on various topics in gaming, and programming. Hopefully other things as
well! There will be posts from other authors here too, on a variety of topics.

What does _Anardil_ mean? It's the name of the [6th king of Gondor from The
Lord of the Rings](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Anardil). The king himself
isn't known for anything particularly special. But the name means "friend of
the sun" in Quenya. I think its an aesthetically pleasing word and like the
meaning.

This is a [small network of websites](https://goto.anardil.net):
